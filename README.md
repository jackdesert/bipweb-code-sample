BIPWeb Code Sample (Rails)
==========================

Please refer to my [bip-audit](https://github.com/jackdesert/bip-audit) code sample
instead of this one.

bip-audit is a more recent sample, and more importantly, has not been
deprecated in the production codebase. Which means we can run bip-audit
and see the working pieces.
